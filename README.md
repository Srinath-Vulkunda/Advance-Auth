# 🔐 MERN Advanced Authentication System

A secure, full-stack authentication system built with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). This project features **OTP-based email verification**, **JWT authentication**, and **welcome emails**, ensuring only verified users are registered. 

Perfect for integration into modern web applications like blogs, dashboards, or e-commerce platforms. ✨

---

## 🚀 Features

- **User Signup/Login**: Secure registration with **JWT authentication** and **bcrypt** password hashing.
- **OTP Email Verification**: An OTP is sent to the user's email (via **Brevo**) for account activation.
- **Welcome Email**: Personalized welcome email after successful verification.
- **Data Integrity**: Unverified credentials are discarded — only verified users are stored in **MongoDB Atlas**.
- **Responsive Frontend**: Built using **React + Tailwind CSS** with forms for signup, OTP verification, and login.
